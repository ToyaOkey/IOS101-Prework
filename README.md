### App Idea

App Idea: **_ATS Resume Screener_**

The ATS Resume Screener is an AI-powered tool that helps job seekers optimize their resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) used by employers. Users can upload a resume and job description with target companies, and the app will analyze them to generate a match percentage, highlight missing keywords needed for the role, rank the keywords and experience, and provide suggestions to improve compatibility. It also detects formatting issues, suggests job-specific bullet points, and tracks resume performance across applications.

## Notes

The only challenges I truly faced was navigating the environment and workspace of `XCode`. Any actual implementation was fairly easy and I felt that the CodePath walkthrough was very helpful. Another hard part was me was also having to learn to build the project and how the emulator works which was a little hard for me at first.
